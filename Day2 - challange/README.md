**2a.** At a restaurant, you order 1 soup for $10, 3 burgers for $8 each, and 1 ice cream for $5.
Use JavaScript to calculate the cost of the order.

**2b.** You’re at a restaurant with 2 friends (3 people in total) and make the same order as 2a.
Calculate how much each person pays.

**2c.** Calculate the total cost of a toaster ($18.50) and 2 shirts ($7.50 each).

**2d.** Calculate a 10% tax for the total in exercise 2c.

**2e.** Calculate a 20% tax for the total in 2c (remember that 1% = 1 / 100,so 20% = 20 / 100 = 0.2).

**Challenge Exercises**
We’ll use JavaScript to convert temperatures from Celsius (ºC) to Fahrenheit (ºF).
The formula is:
Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9 / 5) + 32
Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9

**2l.** The temperature is 25ºC. Calculate the temperature in Fahrenheit. (77)

**2m.** The temperature is 86ºF. Calculate the temperature in Celsius. (30)

**2n.** The temperature is -5ºC. Calculate the temperature in Fahrenheit. (23)
