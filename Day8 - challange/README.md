**Activity1**
Weâ€™ll improve the coin flip game
  Create two buttons labeled heads and tails to play the game.
  When clicking the heads button, play the game with guess = 'heads'.  
  When clicking the tails button, play the game with guess = 'tails'.
  Create a reusable function named playGame(guess) to handle the game logic.
  
**Activity2**
Create a score object like this:
{ wins: 0, losses: 0 }
Update the score each time the game is played and display the updated score in the console.

**Activity2**
Use localStorage to save and load the score object.
(Hint: Use JSON.stringify() to convert the score object to a string before saving, and JSON.parse() to convert it back after loading.)
